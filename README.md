🔍 What's Inside?
Entity & Relationship Extraction – Leverage OpenAI's GPT models to parse text and identify key entities and their connections.

Interactive Graph Visualization – Generate dynamic, explorable graphs from extracted data.

Streamlit-Powered UI – Simple, user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

Colab Notebook Integration – Run directly in Google Colab for quick experimentation.

⚡️ Inspiration
This project is an enhanced version of this YouTube tutorial, modified to use GitHub Marketplace API keys for easier access.
